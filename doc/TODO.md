## FRI Verifier - Degree Bounds

### Check degree bounds
- [ ] Get the degree bounds and check what the degree bounds are
  - This impacts whether we need to implement `FriVerifier` in a way that works with multiple degree bounds
  - Need to understand if different parts of the proof use different degree bounds
  - Determine if a single-degree or multi-degree FRI verifier implementation is required

## Cairo Components Analysis

### Analyze log_size dependencies
- [ ] Analyze how many cairo components may be dependent on log_size and make a list
